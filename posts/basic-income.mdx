excerpt: "Hey I'm the Report lede. Since a large-scale, nationwide basic income scheme has yet to be implemented, there is little direct empirical evidence for its impact on growth, especially in high-income countries. Existing studies draw from three primary sources: econometric models, extrapolation from smaller scale experiments in high-income countries, and studies from lower and middle income countries."

### 38 million Americans live in poverty. An additional 68 million live in economic insecurity.

The rapidly shifting economy of the past 50 years has decoupled economic progress from shared prosperity. Job automation, inequalities of wealth and power, and stagnating wages all threaten to leave more Americans behind in the coming decades.

Today, losing a job is far more catastrophic for an individual than losing an employee is for a company. But even the employed suffer from economic insecurity and the looming threat of poverty, both of which are unhealthy for growth and stability.

### A basic income is an unconditional, regular cash payment that guarantees a baseline of economic stability to all citizens.

Proposals differ on:

- Whether the payments are "universal" to all citizens, or "targeted" towards those with lower incomes.
- The amount of income guaranteed by the program.
- Whether it includes children.
- How much of the existing welfare safety net it replaces.
- How to pay for it.

Depending on its design, advocates argue a basic income could:

- Significantly reduce or eliminate poverty.
- Stimulate growth by redistributing cash towards those who are more likely to spend it.
- Promote entrepreneurship by decreasing risk.
- Increase the bargaining power of workers and reduce inequality.
- Support a series of social benefits, including improved physical and mental health, educational, and familial outcomes.
- Decrease the bureaucratic inefficiencies of welfare provision by combining patchwork income support programs into a single program.

### Skeptics argue that a basic income could:

- Discourage work and foster welfare dependence.
- Be prohibitively expensive and irresponsibly spent.
- Be less effective than other uses of tax revenue.
- Cause price inflation.
